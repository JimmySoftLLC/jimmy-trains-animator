Lumberjack: Hey there, little green fella! What brings you to this neck of the woods?
Alien: Greetings, Earthling! I couldn't help but notice that you've been quite busy chopping down these magnificent trees.  Since I don't have vocal cords. I am using the trees to speak to you.  Don't be alarmed that they shake a little.
Lumberjack: Well, it's my job, you know. Gotta feed the kids.
Alien: Well my intergalactic species depends on these trees for our daily nourishment.
Lumberjack: Oh, really? You eat trees? I always thought aliens survived on cosmic energy or something.  I guess it makes you a vegetarian.
Alien: No, no. We have a book called how to serve man. But for a later subject.  Trees are like our version of a appetizer. And let me tell you, these ones you've been chopping down, they were our favorite appetizers before the man meal... oh I mean main meal.
Lumberjack: Well, I apologize if I've been interrupting your intergalactic feast. But hey, you could've left a text. I would've reconsidered!
Alien: Oh, my apologies. I must have misplaced my phone. It must be in the same place I left the how to serve man book.
Lumberjack: Haha! Now, now, Mr. Alien, let's not get too upset. How about this? I promise to leave one tree standing for every ten I chop down. A little compromise, eh?
Alien: That sounds fair, Earthling. And to show my gratitude, I shall bestow upon you the secret recipe for our famous stew. If I could only find the how to serve man book.  Just remember, it requires a dash of cosmic stardust for that spacey flavor.
Lumberjack: Deal! I'll make sure to sprinkle it liberally. And who knows, maybe this newfound alliance will lead to a whole new interstellar cuisine trend. Famous Alien stew, coming to a restaurant near you!
Alien: Haha! I can already picture it: "The Galaxy's Gourmet Delight: Lumberjack's Lunar Lumberhouse." It has a nice ring to it, don't you think?
Lumberjack: Absolutely! And we'll have a mascot too—a little green alien with a chainsaw, chopping down trees and serving man in zero gravity!
Alien: Perfect! Just make sure it doesn't scare away the customers... After all, the only thing more terrifying than an alien invasion... is a restaurant with terrible Alien food!  I definitely should have a touch of man in it.

Alien: 

Greetings, Earthling! I am using the trees to speak to you.  Don't be alarmed when they shake.  It's how I transfer my brain waves to sound.  I have noticed that you are chopping down these magnificent trees.  

Well my intergalactic species depends on these trees for our nourishment.

Haha! No, no. We have a book called how to serve man. But for a later subject.  Trees are like our version of a appetizer. And let me tell you, these ones you've been chopping down, they were our favorite appetizers before the man meal... oh I mean main meal.

Perfect! Just make sure it doesn't scare away the customers... After all, the only thing more terrifying than an alien invasion... is a restaurant with terrible Alien food.  My favorite version is, when it has a touch of man in it.
