The animator incline is our most elaborate animator yet.
It features computer controlled car motion.
It has 48 individually addressable lights.
It has stereo sound.
There are lights in the left and right car.
There are lights in the upper and lower house.
There are lights on the balcony.
There are lights in the balcony stair chase.
There are colored lights on the track bed.
The cars are counterbalanced using a cable and driven by pulleys and a motor.
A laser distance sensor is used to precisely located the cars.  In the house.  And down the track.
You animate your incline using scripts which this demo is just one of many.
Have fun animating with Jimmy Trains animators.
