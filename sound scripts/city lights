Welcome. This is a prototype of the new Animator City Lights product. It will animate 
your city by turning lights on in off in scenes you create. 

Lets demonstrate with a employee opening the department store, servicing customers and then closing the store.

These scenes are created 
using scripts. Some scripts are pre programed for your building type. 
Or you can write them yourself. Lets demonstrate using the davenport department store script.

Notice that City Lights neo 6 hv light drivers are plug compatible for woodland scenics buildings as well as 12 volt light strips.

We also sell a neo 6 light driver that can power individual leds at 20 milli amps.

No drop down resistors are necessary.

If you want color we got you covered also. The system is compatible with 5V neo pixels strips.

We also have drivers to control Lifx bulbs.  So you can do night to day scene changes.

The possibilities are endless.

Enjoy the animation.
