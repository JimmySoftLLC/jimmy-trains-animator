    we wish you a merry christmas.
    angels we have heard on high.
    joyful snowman.
    carol of the bells.
    dance of the sugar-plum fairy.
    deck the halls jazzy version.
    the wassail song.
    jingle bells orchestra.
    away in a manger.
    joy to the world.
    silent night.
    auld lang syne jazzy version.
