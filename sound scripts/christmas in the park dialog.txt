    we wish you a merry christmas.
    angels we have heard on high.
    joyful snowman.
    carol of the bells.
    dance of the sugar-plum fairy.
    deck the halls jazzy version.
    the wassail song.
    jingle bells orchestra.
    away in a manger.
    joy to the world.
    silent night.
    auld lang syne jazzy version.

You can add your own sound tracks to your animator.  

You can create your own sound track files by putting wav files in the folder called  "customers_owned_music" on the microSD card that is inserted 
in your animator.  The files must be named with only lower case letters, numbers and spaces. For example "white christmas". The files must be wav files encoded with a sample rate of 22050Hz and a sample format of 16 bits. 
You can create files of this type using Audacity, a free application.
